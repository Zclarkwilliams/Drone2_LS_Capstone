## Team Members: 
Brett Creeley, Daniel Christiansen, Ethan Grinnell, Kirk Hooper, and Zachary Clark-Williams<br>

## Description:<br>
Drone2, an evolution and general enhancement of a MachXO3 FPGA drone controller. The general enhancements will have the centralized main objective of achieving stability of flight. The evolution will be an as-possible based requirement, where the team will implement CV, mobile app based control, and/or other features if time and budget permits.<br>
<br>
The Drone2 project is based on a previous PSU capstone team project, in which an off-the-shelf drone was chosen, its flight controller board was removed and a Lattice Semiconductor development board device was integrated in its place. The final product that was produced was capable of receiving the data that corresponded to the users manipulation of a remote control, pushing the new yaw, throttle, elevator and aileron values through four, or more, equations that controls the pulse width modulated square wave signal, which is sent to the drones original electronic speed controls consequently adjusting the output signal to the motor and adjusting their individual speed.<br>
<br>
All equations and motors are controlled independently, without any control loops to handle stable flight. From the platform that was just described, sensors and other devices will be added to achieve stability.<br>
